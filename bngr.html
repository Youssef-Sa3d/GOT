            <h1>About</h1>
            <article>
                Queen Daenerys I Targaryen, also known as Daenerys Stormborn, and affectionately known as Dany, was the
                only daughter of
                King Aerys II Targaryen and Queen Rhaella, the younger sister of Rhaegar and Viserys Targaryen, and was
                born at Dragonstone.
                <br><br>
                Daenerys was initially a timid, obedient youth. After her marriage to Drogo she gathered the confidence
                of his khalasar.
                Following his death, she expanded her dominion into Essos, gaining the loyalty of an army of Unsullied
                and liberating
                Slaver's Bay from the Ghiscari slave masters.
                <br><br>
                During her war for Westeros, Daenerys eventually succumbed to the so-called "Targaryen madness" of her
                ancestors after a
                series of personal losses, grief, and betrayal. Razing King's Landing despite its surrender, Daenerys
                seized power after
                killing Queen Cersei Lannister, along with countless common folk. Unable to be dissuaded from further
                destruction, she
                was assassinated by her nephew Jon Snow to prevent further carnage. She was later succeeded by Bran the
                Broken, elected
                by the Great Council of 305 AC.

                    <h1>Drogon</h1>
                    <p>Named after Drogo, Drogon was the personal mount of Daenerys and THE dragon in 'Game of Thrones'.
                        The biggest of the
                        original three, Drogon helped his rider win many wars both in the book and in the TV show. After
                        Daenerys' death in
                        'Game of Thrones', Drogon was reported to be flying east over the continent of Essos. Tyrion
                        Lannister had a memorable
                        encounter with Drogon.</p>

                    <p>Named after Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, the elder brother of Daenerys. In 'Game of Thrones',
                        Rhaegal was killed with a
                        scorpion bow by Euron Greyjoy. Jon Snow, who was revealed as Rhaegar's son and the nephew of
                        Daenerys, also rode the
                        dragon in the last season of the TV show.</p>

                    <p>Named after Daenerys' other brother Viserys, Viserion was killed by the Night King in front of
                        Daenerys during season 7.
                        The Night King subsequently revived and rode him, with Viserion becoming a part of the White
                        Walkers' army. He finally
                        died when Arya Stark killed the Night King.</p>
